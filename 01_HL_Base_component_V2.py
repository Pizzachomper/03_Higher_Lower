^*^ How to Play Higher Lower ^*^
This is a game made to play Higher/Lower in python. 
Answer with how many rounds you will play or type enter for infinite mode. 
Please type a number between 1-100 and see if you can find the computer choice.
The computer will respond if the number is higher or lower than the given response.
You have only 9 attempts to guess the number. But if you dont want to play anymore type xxx or x to quit, 
you can see your game summary at the end of your game and how many guesses you have done. 
Enjoy ðŸ˜†
