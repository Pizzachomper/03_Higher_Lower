^*^ How to Play Higher Lower ^*^
This is a game made to play Higher/Lower in python. 
Answer with how many rounds you will play or type enter for infinite mode. 
Please type a number between 1-100 and see if you can find the computer choice.
The computer will respond if the number is higher or lower than the given response.
You have only 6 attempts to guess the number. But if you dont want to play anymore type xxx to quit, 
you can see your game summary at the end of your game and how many guesses you have done. 
Enjoy ðŸ˜†
